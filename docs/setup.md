# VibSDK Setup Guide

Local first time setup guide for VibSDK - get your AI coding platform running locally and also ready to be deployed.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

### Required
- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Cloudflare account** with API access  
- **Cloudflare API Token** with appropriate permissions

### Recommended
- **Bun** (automatically installed by setup script for better performance)
- **Custom domain** configured in Cloudflare (for production deployment)

### For Production Features
- **Workers Paid Plan** (for remote Cloudflare resources)
- **Workers for Platforms** subscription (for app deployment features)
- **Advanced Certificate Manager** (if using first-level subdomains)

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get VibSDK running is with our automated setup script:

```bash
npm run setup
# Or if you already have Bun installed: bun run setup
```

This interactive script will guide you through the entire setup process, including:

- **Package manager setup** (installs Bun automatically for better performance)
- **Cloudflare credentials** collection (Account ID and API Token)
- **Domain configuration** (custom domain or localhost for development)
- **Remote setup** (optional production deployment configuration)
- **AI Gateway configuration** (Cloudflare AI Gateway recommended)
- **API key collection** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI Studio, etc.)
- **OAuth setup** (Google, GitHub login - optional)
- **Resource creation** (KV namespaces, D1 databases, R2 buckets, AI Gateway)
- **File generation** (`.dev.vars` and optionally `.prod.vars`)
- **Configuration updates** (`wrangler.jsonc` and `vite.config.ts`)
- **Database setup** (schema generation and migrations)
- **Template deployment** (example app templates to R2)
- **Readiness report** (comprehensive status and next steps)

## What You'll Need During Setup

The setup script will ask you for the following information:

### Cloudflare Account Information

1. **Account ID**: Found in your Cloudflare dashboard sidebar
2. **API Token**: Create one with these permissions:
   - **Account** - Account:Read
   - **Zone** - Zone Settings:Edit, Zone:Edit, DNS:Edit (if using custom domain)
   - **Account** - Workers KV Storage:Edit, D1:Edit, Workers Scripts:Edit, Workers AI:Edit
   - **Account** - R2:Edit (for object storage)
   - **Account** - Cloudflare Images:Edit (for image handling)
   - **Account** - Account Rulesets:Edit (for rate limiting)

   **Important**: Some features like D1 databases and R2 may require a paid Cloudflare plan.

### Domain Configuration

The script now uses a **simplified, upfront domain configuration**:

**With Custom Domain:**
```bash
Enter your custom domain (or press Enter to skip): myapp.com
✅ Custom domain set: myapp.com
Use remote Cloudflare resources (KV, D1, R2, etc.)? (Y/n): 
Configure for production deployment? (Y/n): 
```

**Without Custom Domain:**
```bash
Enter your custom domain (or press Enter to skip): [press Enter]
⚠️  No custom domain provided.
   • Remote Cloudflare resources: Not available
   • Production deployment: Not available
   • Only local development will be configured

Continue with local-only setup? (Y/n): 
```

**Benefits:**
- **One-time decision**: Domain asked once, used for both dev and production
- **Clear consequences**: Script explains what features are unavailable without domain
- **Retry option**: Can go back if you change your mind
- **Y/n defaults**: Capital letter shows default choice (press Enter)

### AI Gateway Configuration

**Cloudflare AI Gateway (Recommended)**
- **Automatic token setup**: When selected, `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is automatically set to your API token
- **No manual configuration**: The script handles all AI Gateway authentication
- **Better performance**: Caching, rate limiting, and monitoring included

**Custom OpenAI URL (Alternative)**
- For users with existing OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Requires manual model configuration in `config.ts`

### AI Provider Selection

The setup script offers multiple AI providers with intelligent multi-selection:

**Available Providers:**
1. **OpenAI** (for GPT models)
2. **Anthropic** (for Claude models)  
3. **Google AI Studio** (for Gemini models) - **Default & Recommended**
4. **Cerebras** (for open source models)
5. **OpenRouter** (for various models)
6. **Custom provider** (for any other provider)

**Provider Selection:**
- Select multiple providers with comma-separated numbers (e.g., `1,2,3`)
- Each selected provider will prompt for its API key
- Custom providers automatically generate `PROVIDER_NAME_API_KEY` variables
- Custom providers are automatically added to `worker-configuration.d.ts`

### Important Model Configuration Notes

**Google AI Studio (Recommended):**
- Default model configurations use Gemini models
- No additional config.ts editing required
- Best performance and compatibility

**Other Providers:**
- **Strong warning**: You MUST edit `worker/agents/inferutils/config.ts` 
- Change default model configurations from Gemini to your selected providers
- Model format: `<provider-name>/<model-name>` (e.g., `openai/gpt-4`, `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`)
- Review fallback model configurations

**Without AI Gateway:**
- **Manual config.ts editing required** for all model configurations
- Model names must follow `<provider-name>/<model-name>` format

### OAuth Configuration

The script will also ask for OAuth credentials:

- **Google OAuth**: For user authentication and login (not AI Studio access)
- **GitHub OAuth**: For user authentication and login
- **GitHub Export OAuth**: For exporting generated apps to GitHub repositories (separate from login OAuth)

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually:

### 1. Create `.dev.vars` file

Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

### 2. Configure Required Variables

```bash
# Essential
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"

# Security
JWT_SECRET="generated-secret"
WEBHOOK_SECRET="generated-secret"

# Domain (optional)
CUSTOM_DOMAIN="your-domain.com"
```

### 3. Create Cloudflare Resources

Create required resources in your Cloudflare account:
- KV Namespace for `VibecoderStore`
- D1 Database named `vibesdk-db`
- R2 Bucket named `vibesdk-templates`

### 4. Update `wrangler.jsonc`

Update resource IDs in `wrangler.jsonc` with the IDs from step 3.

## Starting Development

After setup is complete:

```bash
# Set up database
npm run db:migrate:local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit your app at `http://localhost:5173`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**D1 Database "Unauthorized" Error**: This usually means:
- Your API token lacks "D1:Edit" permissions
- Your account doesn't have access to D1 (may require paid plan)
- You've exceeded your D1 database quota
- **Solution**: Update your API token permissions or upgrade your Cloudflare plan

**Permission Errors**: Ensure your API token has all required permissions listed above.

**Domain Not Found**: Make sure your domain is:
- Added to Cloudflare
- DNS is properly configured
- API token has zone permissions

**Resource Creation Failed**: Check that your account has:
- Available KV namespace quota (10 on free plan)
- D1 database quota (may require paid plan)
- R2 bucket quota (may require paid plan)
- Appropriate plan level for requested features

**R2 Bucket "Unauthorized" Error**: This usually means:
- Your API token lacks "R2:Edit" permissions
- Your account doesn't have access to R2 (may require paid plan)
- You've exceeded your R2 bucket quota
- **Solution**: Update your API token permissions or upgrade your Cloudflare plan

**AI Configuration Issues**:
- **"AI Gateway token already configured" but token not in .dev.vars**: Re-run setup, this was a bug that's now fixed
- **Models not working with custom providers**: Edit `worker/agents/inferutils/config.ts` to change default model configurations
- **Custom provider not recognized**: Check that the provider was added to `worker-configuration.d.ts`
- **AI Gateway creation failed**: Ensure your API token has AI Gateway permissions

**Local Development & Tunnel Issues**:
- **Cloudflared tunnel timeout**: Wait 20-30 seconds, then refresh. Tunnel creation can be slow
- **"Tunnel creation failed"**: This is normal occasionally. The app will still work with regular preview URLs
- **Sandbox instances dying**: Normal behavior if they restart successfully. Only worry if persistent
- **Preview URL not accessible**: Check if tunnel is still creating, or try refreshing the instance
- **Multiple port exposure issues on macOS**: Use tunnels (`USE_TUNNEL_FOR_PREVIEW=true`) - this is the default

**Deploy to Cloudflare Button Issues (Chat Interface)**:
- **"Deploy button not working locally"**: Chat interface deploy button requires custom domain, initial deployment, and remote dispatch bindings
- **"Dispatch namespace not found"**: Deploy your VibSDK project to Cloudflare at least once first
- **"Deploy fails with authentication error"**: Ensure your custom domain is properly configured and deployed
- **Note**: This refers to deploying generated apps from the chat interface, not GitHub repository deployments

**Corporate Network Issues**:
- **SSL/TLS certificate errors in Docker containers**: Corporate networks often use custom root CA certificates
- **Cloudflared tunnel failures**: May be blocked by corporate proxies or require certificate trust
- **Package installation failures**: npm/bun installs may fail due to certificate validation

**Corporate Network Solutions**:
If you're on a corporate network with custom SSL certificates, you'll need to modify the `SandboxDockerfile`:

1. **Copy your corporate root CA certificate** to the project root (don't commit to git!)
2. **Edit SandboxDockerfile** to include your certificate:

```dockerfile
# Add your company's Root CA certificate for corporate network access
COPY your-root-ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/your-root-ca.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates

# Set SSL environment variables for cloudflared and other tools
ENV SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
ENV NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/your-root-ca.crt
ENV CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

**⚠️ Security Warning**: Never commit corporate CA certificates to public repositories. Use `.gitignore` to exclude certificate files and only use this for local development.

### Getting Help

1. Check the setup report for specific issues and suggestions
2. Review the Cloudflare Workers documentation
3. Ensure all prerequisites are met

## Production Deployment

If you configured remote deployment during setup, you'll have a `.prod.vars` file ready for production. Deploy with:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the application
- Update Cloudflare resources 
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
- Apply database migrations
- Configure custom domain routing (if specified)

### Production-Only Setup

If you only set up for local development initially, you can configure production later:

1. **Run setup again** and choose "yes" for remote deployment configuration
2. **Provide production domain** when prompted
3. **Deploy** using `npm run deploy`

### Manual Production Setup

Alternatively, create `.prod.vars` manually based on `.dev.vars` but with:
- Production domain in `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`
- Production API keys and secrets
- `ENVIRONMENT="prod"`

## Next Steps

Once setup is complete:

1. **Start developing** with `npm run dev`
2. **Visit** `http://localhost:5173` to access VibSDK
3. **Try generating** your first AI-powered application
4. **Deploy to production** when ready with `npm run deploy`

## File Structure After Setup

The setup script creates and modifies these files:

```
vibesdk/
├── .dev.vars              # Local development environment variables
├── .prod.vars             # Production environment variables (if configured)
├── wrangler.jsonc         # Updated with resource IDs and domain
├── vite.config.ts         # Updated for remote/local bindings
├── migrations/            # Database migration files
└── templates/             # Template repository (downloaded)
```

## Important Caveats & Known Issues

### **Local Development with Cloudflared Tunnels**

**Default Behavior**: Local development uses cloudflared tunnels by default (`USE_TUNNEL_FOR_PREVIEW=true`)

**Why Tunnels?**
- **MacBook compatibility**: Cloudflare sandbox SDK Docker images have issues with multiple exposed ports on macOS
- **Simplified networking**: Avoids complex localhost proxying setup
- **Quick development**: Provides immediate external access for testing

**Tunnel Limitations**:
- **Startup time**: Tunnel creation can take 10-20 seconds
- **Timeouts**: Tunnel creation may timeout occasionally (this is normal)
- **External dependency**: Requires internet connection and cloudflare.com access

### **"Deploy to Cloudflare" Button Limitations (Chat Interface)**

The "Deploy to Cloudflare" button in the chat interface (for generated apps) has specific requirements for local development:

> **Note**: This refers to the deployment button within the VibSDK platform's chat interface, not the GitHub repository deploy button.

**Requirements**:
1. **Custom domain** must be properly configured during setup
2. **Initial deployment** - Project must be deployed at least once to your Cloudflare account
3. **Remote dispatch bindings** - `wrangler.jsonc` must have remote dispatch namespace enabled
4. **Dispatch worker** - A dispatch worker must be running in your account

**Why These Requirements?**
- The deploy feature uses Cloudflare's dispatch namespace system
- Dispatch requires a running worker in your account to handle deployment requests
- Local-only development isn't yet supported for this in vibesdk

**Current Status**: Making "Deploy to Cloudflare" work completely in local-only mode is not yet implemented.

### **Sandbox Instance Behavior**

**Normal Behavior**:
- **Instance restarts**: Sandbox deployments may occasionally die and restart
- **Temporary failures**: Short-term deployment failures are expected
- **Self-healing**: The system will retry and recover automatically

**When to Be Concerned**:
- Consistent failures over 5+ minutes
- Complete inability to create instances
- Persistent networking issues

**What's Normal**:
- Individual instance failures that resolve quickly
- Occasional tunnel connection issues
- Brief periods of unavailability during restarts If issue persists, please open an issue on GitHub with the status report and any additional information you think would be helpful.
